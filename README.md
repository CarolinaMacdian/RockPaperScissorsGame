 AI Dominates the World: Rock, Paper, Scissors Edition

 
## About the Project

Welcome to "AI Dominates the World: Rock, Paper, Scissors Edition"! This is a fun and interactive JavaScript project where an AI has its sights set on world domination, but only through the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Will you be able to outwit and defeat the AI?

In this project, we've created an AI opponent that uses advanced strategies to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against human players.

This project was developed as part of our exploration into artificial intelligence, game theory, and interactive web applications. It's a lighthearted take on how AI might try to achieve its goals through unexpected means.
